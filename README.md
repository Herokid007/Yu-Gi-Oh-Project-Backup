## The Project Brief:  
The aim for the project was to design a web application intergrated with a database via Python using Flask micro-framework. The design for the app needed to have a CRUD functionality (create, read, update, and delete), and to store the information via a MySQL database consisting of two tables and sharing a one-to-many relationship. The CI/CD pipeline creates the automation via Jenkins deployment, then the app is deployed using Docker products (Dockerfile, Docker-Compose, & Docker-Swarm) interfaced using Microsoft Azure VMs.
